# Data Structures Visualizations

Simple website that features the stack, binary tree, and avl tree. Only works on very very very small data sets. Used for CS 290, web development at OSU.

## Running

[Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) has to be installed. 

### Build

Run `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to serve at `http://localhost:37539`.

For windows, there is an error where parcel hangs when building. To fix, run `npm run dev` like 3 times.

### Development/Watch

Run `npm run dev`

Note: Will not listen to child `scss` files.
