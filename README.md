# Data Structures Visualizations

View at [Data Structures Visualizations](http://138.68.4.225)

Simple website that features the stack, binary tree, and avl tree. Only works on very very very small data sets. Used for CS 290, web development at OSU.

## Running

[Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) and typescript have to be installed. 

### Build

Run `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to serve at `http://localhost:37539`.

For windows, there is an error where parcel hangs when building. To fix, run `npm run dev` like 3 times.

### Development/Watch

Run `npm run dev`

Note: Will not listen to child `scss` file on windows.
